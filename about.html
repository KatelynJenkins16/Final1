            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p> My name is Katelyn Jenkins. I am 17 years old and have lived in Colorado my whole life. I love the mountains and snowboarding. 
            In my free time I like to play flag football and run track. I am a rising senior in high school. My dream school is The United States Naval Academy. 
            I have one brother (Riley) and 2 dogs (Lulu and Mambo). I love being outside especially camping and being out on the lake, paddleboarding or just floating in the life jacket.

          <h3>Why i Cook?</h3>
          <p>I originally started cooking because my dad said it was an essential life skill, but eventually I fell in love with being able to create something I knew I would eat. 
            Eventually, when my family began camping more, I had to learn how to cook outside of the house. 
            This led to me learning simple recipes that can be made almost anywhere. Now, with me leaving for college in just over a year, I have gained confidence to live on my own and still eat healthy.</p>
