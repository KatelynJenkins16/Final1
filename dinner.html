    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Pesto Pasta</h3>
    <div class="flex-containerL">
        <div class="left-text">
          <ul>Ingredients:
            <li>2 cups packed fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: 1/2 lemon juice for brightness</li>
            <li>300–350 g (10–12 oz) pasta of your choice (spaghetti, penne, bucatini, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="center-text">
          <ol>Instructions:
            <li>Make the pesto: In a food processor or blender, combine basil leaves, Parmesan cheese, garlic, toasted pine nuts, salt, and pepper. Pulse until coarsely blended. While blending, slowly drizzle in olive oil until the mixture is smooth and emulsified. Add lemon juice if using. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Drain pasta and transfer to a large bowl (not the hot pot).</li>
            <li>Combine pasta and pesto: Add the pesto to the hot pasta. Add reserved pasta water gradually (about 1/4 cup at a time) and toss to coat the pasta evenly with a silky, glossy pesto sauce. The starch in the pasta water emulsifies with the pesto oil for perfect texture. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve: Garnish with extra Parmesan cheese and cherry tomatoes if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
          </ol>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Flat Top Tacos</h3>
    <div class="flex-containerR">
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/grillnationbbq.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/birria.jpg?fit=1440%2C1920" alt="tacos" class="left-imageL">
        <div class="center-textL">
          <ol>Instructions:
            <li>Preheat the flat top griddle to medium-high heat (around 350-400°F) and add oil, spreading it evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the ground beef: Add the ground beef to the griddle and break it apart with a spatula. Season with taco seasoning and add salsa for flavor. Stir and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add water: Pour a small amount of water into the beef mixture to help render the seasonings and keep the meat moist. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Cook onions and chiles (optional): On a separate section of the griddle, sauté chopped onions and green chiles in a bit of oil until softened, then mix them into the beef.</li>
            <li>Heat tortillas: Place corn tortillas on the griddle to warm and get slightly crispy. You can use some grease from the beef or add a little butter/oil to crisp them up.</li>
            <li>Assemble tacos on the griddle: Sprinkle shredded cheese on one half of each tortilla, then add a portion of the cooked beef mixture on top of the cheese. Add optional toppings like cilantro.</li>
            <li>Fold and crisp: Fold the tortilla over the filling and press down with a spatula. Cook for a few minutes on each side until the tortilla is crispy and the cheese melts, forming a taco dorado style.</li>
            <li>Serve: Remove from the griddle, drain excess oil on paper towels if needed, and serve with your favorite taco toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, avocado, and hot sauce.</li>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Homade Pizzas</h3>
    <div class="flex-containerR">

        <div class="center-textL">
          <ol>Instructions:
            <li>Preheat the pizza stone: Place your pizza stone on the lowest rack of a cold oven. Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C) and allow the stone to heat for at least 30-60 minutes to ensure it is thoroughly hot.</li>
            <li>Prepare the dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a piece of parchment paper to about a 14-inch circle. The parchment paper helps with easy transfer onto the stone.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pizza: Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough. Sprinkle about 2 cups of mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Arrange the pepperoni slices evenly on top of the cheese. Then add the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese over the pepperoni for a layered cheesy effect.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the stone: Using a pizza peel, slide the pizza along with the parchment paper onto the hot pizza stone in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake the pizza for 10-14 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. You can check the bottom crust with a spatula to ensure it is crisp and golden.</li>
            <li>Cool and serve: Remove the pizza from the oven using the peel and transfer it to a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes. Then cut with pizza scissors or a pizza cutter and serve warm.</li>
          </ol>
